# Vision

- Focused on gathering resources
- Game goal is to clear a level as quickly as possible
  - Clear a level by gathering all the resources
- Focus on simplicity
- No direct control of workers as a constraint

# Currently working on

# Possible next steps

- Make upgrades more satisfying
  - Show a little circular timer for gather time?
  - Show a little number for how many minerals are picked up?
  - Speed is already satisfying, but is there an improvement?
    - Motion blur?
    - Motion lines?
  - Show what level each upgrade is at?
- Improve AI
  - Allow for more than one worker on a mineral patch
- Levels
  - Larger and smaller?
- Obstacles?
  - Barriers that can be broken somehow?
  - Cliffs or gaps that need a bridge or some other upgrade?
- Graphics
  - Better colour palette?
  - Animal theme?
  - Other themes?
  - Small world graphics style?
- Different types of workers?
- "skills"?
  - Cast an area effect
    - Could upgrade all workers' speed in the area
    - Increase gather amounts
- Different types of resources?
  - How do you prioritize one over the other?
  - Different worker types collect different resources?
- High scores?
- Add more control to the workers?
  - Maybe not, no direct control is a fun constraint
- Collapse upgrades into one great upgrade?
  - Would be in line with the focus on simplicity
